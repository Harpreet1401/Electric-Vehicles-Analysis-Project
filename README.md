# Electric-Vehicles-Analysis-Project
### ‚≠ï Problem Statement
American automotive behemoth AtliQ Motors is an expert in electric cars (EVs). Their market share in the North American market for electric and hybrid vehicles increased to 25% during the last five years. They intended to introduce their best-selling models in India, where they have a market share of less than 2%, as part of their expansion plans. Before moving forward, Bruce Haryali, the CEO of AtliQ Motors India, intended to conduct a thorough market analysis of the country's current EV/hybrid market. Bruce assigned this assignment to the AtliQ Motors data analytics team, which includes Peter Pandey as a data analyst.

The dashboard provides you with the electric vehicle growth in India over three years (2022, 2023, and 2024). That helps to know how the makers are performing in each state, who are your tough competitors, and which state is performing well with the upcoming technologies.
